# pyMet
A simple visual metronome written in Python

Updated 2/18/2015

Summary
pyMet is a simple visual metronome written in Python for a CLI (command line interface) such as Terminal. 



1. How to run in Terminal

  * Open Terminal.
  * Navigate to the folder which the pyMet.py file is located using LS (list directory), and CD (change directory).
  * Type "python pyMet.py" and hit enter.
  * You will be prompted for BPM (beats per minute). Enter a value between 80 - 180 (most music falls in these           tempos)
  * To end the program press "control-c".
  

  
2. Future Improvement Ideas (please feel welcome to contribute)

  ‚çª Added on 2/18/2014. User defined time signature - counting range via initial prompt. Ex. "How many counts? 6"        Then the program will cycle through 1-6.
  * Instead of the counts appearing on a new line, they appear in the same spot on one line. 
  * Add a stop and start with "spacebar". 
  * Add a restart with a single key command like enter.
  * Trigger a sound file to play when each count happens. Bonus: Use Python synthesis
  * Add a second sound to accent the first count of each cycle. 
  * Replace counts with large ASCII art like a giant 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. 
  * Increase or decrease in increments of 1 BPM with left and right arrow keys, with new speed displayed.
  * Increase or decrease in increments of 10 BPM with up and down arrow keys, with new speed displayed.
